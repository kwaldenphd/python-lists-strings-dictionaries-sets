    "# Python Syntax: Methods and Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python has some specific terminology used to describe elements of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Syntax: Programming languages have their own syntax, which are a set of rules that determine how programs (commands, lines of code) are written and interpreted. The language syntax includes both elements of the code visible to human readers as well as elements of the code executed by the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Function: We have a whole lab coming up on functions. For now, we can think of functions as a group of statements that perform a specific task. Python includes built-in functions like `print()`, `dict()`, `input()`, `int()`, and `len()`, but also allows you to create your own functions. Data, parameters, or arguments can be passed into a function, and a function can also return data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Parameters and arguments can be used interchangeably in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Method: In Python, a method is something that is applied to an object. That object could be a variable, string, number, or other type of data. A method is a function that is available for objects based on their type. For example `append()`, `extend()`, `sort()`, and `reverse()` are all methods that can be used with `list` object types. `capitalize()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, and `title()` are all methods that can be used with `string` object types.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Function vs. Method: Functions are generic, while a method is called on an object. A method is associated with an object (and can access/interact with the data or information that is part of that object). Functions do not alter the state of an object, while a method can alter an object state.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "7. We worked with variables in our first Python lab. A variable is a placeholder for a piece of information. You can think of it as a basket or container. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Python has a few rules for variables:\n",
    "- Variable names can only include letter, numbers, or underscores, but cannot start with a number.\n",
    "- Spaces are not permitted.\n",
    "- The names of Python methods and functions are reserved, meaning that they cannot be used as variable names. So, `print` cannot be used as a variable name.\n",
    "- As a rule, variable names should be short and descriptive."
