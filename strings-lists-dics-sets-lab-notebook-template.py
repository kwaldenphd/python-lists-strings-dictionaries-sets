"""Q1: In your own words, explain the difference between `print(hello)` and `print(“hello”)`."""



"""Q2: Describe the syntax of the three commands that we just used (steps 10-14) in your own words. What is this code doing? Define the function and method for each example."""



"""Q3: Explain how each of these two programs (steps 15-18) work in your own words."""



"""Q4: Why does `print(2//3)` return `0`? How would you modify your code to return the decimal number? Why?"""



"""Q5: Explain concatenation in your own words. Why must we convert numbers to strings in the program above? Refer to this example and the previous example."""



"""Q6: Write a program that converts integer, float, or boolean values to a string, using the `str()` function."""



"""Q7: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a 6-letter word, and then prints the first, third, and fifth letters of that word."""



"""Q8: Modify the program to have it search for other characters in the string. Does it always return the index number you expect? What index is returned if you ask for the index of the letter u (i.e., what happens when the desired character appears more than once in the string)?"""



"""Q9: How would you modify this code to output the full range 1 to 10?"""



"""Q10: How would you rewrite the code to include only the even numbers from 1 to 10?"""

# What is the second element?
# How would you change 4 to 'four'?
# How would you change 1 to 'one'?
# How would you print out each sub-list (one sub-list per line)?
# How would you print out each number (one number per line)?



"""Q12: Create your own list of numbers. Include your list code as part of this question answer. What is the length of your list? What is the number position for each of the items in your list? How would you return the value of the first item? How would you return the value of the last item?"""



"""Q13: Using the same list from the previous question, write a program that includes the following steps or components:"""
# Adds a new item to your list
# Deletes an item from your list
# Sorts your list in-place
# Generates a sorted version of your list
# Reverses your list in-place
# Determines the min and max values for your list
# Selects an list element at random
# Shuffles your list




"""Q14: Create your own list of strings. Include your list code as part of this question answer. What is the length of your list? What is the number position for each of the items in your list? How would you return the value of the first item? How would you return the value of the last item?"""

# Test to see if the value 7 is a member of the set.
# Add a value to the set.
# Remove a value from the set.
